## ABSTRACT

We exploit policy variation across five ASEAN countries (2020-2025) to test whether tax rate competition occurs in digital services taxation. Despite statutory rates varying from 6% to 12%, we find no systematic relationship between rates and revenue collection. Panel regression analysis yields a tax rate coefficient of -18.34 with a standard error of 21.87, failing to reject the null hypothesis of no effect (p=0.415). Using difference-in-differences analysis of Malaysia's 2024 tax base expansion, we show that broadening the tax base causally increases revenue by $114 million annually (p=0.034), while rate variation shows no measurable impact. We develop a game-theoretic model demonstrating that destination-based digital taxation eliminates strategic rate interaction because the tax base—consumers—is immobile. Mediation analysis reveals that compliance rates endogenously adjust to offset statutory rate differences, while variance decomposition shows that tax base breadth explains ten times more revenue variation than rate policy. Our findings challenge classical tax competition theory and suggest that developing countries should prioritize tax base expansion over rate optimization when designing digital taxation systems.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

The digital economy presents a fundamental challenge to traditional tax systems designed around physical presence and permanent establishment. When a consumer in Manila streams Netflix, purchases from Amazon, or uses a ride-hailing app, economic value is created and taxed (or not) based on principles developed for brick-and-mortar commerce. By 2024, Southeast Asia's digital economy reached $200 billion in transaction value, yet governments struggled to capture revenue from cross-border digital services.

Between January 2020 and December 2025, five major ASEAN economies implemented distinct digital services tax regimes with statutory rates ranging from 6% in Malaysia to 12% in the Philippines. This variation creates a natural laboratory for testing theories of tax competition. Classical models predict that when capital is mobile across jurisdictions, governments engage in a race to the bottom on tax rates to prevent base erosion (Zodrow and Mieszkowski 1986; Wilson 1999). Countries raising rates should experience base flight to lower-rate neighbors, generating convergence toward inefficiently low taxation.

ASEAN digital taxation defies this prediction. Despite five years of parallel systems, rates show no convergence. More surprisingly, we find that statutory tax rates do not systematically predict revenue collection. Countries with high rates collect similar revenue per unit of digital economy as countries with low rates after controlling for economy size and system maturity. This paper asks why.

We provide three answers grounded in theory, causal evidence, and mechanism analysis. First, we develop a formal model showing that destination-based digital taxation fundamentally differs from classical tax competition scenarios. Because digital services taxes are levied where consumers are located rather than where platforms operate, the tax base is immobile even when platforms themselves are mobile. Platforms cannot relocate consumers to low-tax jurisdictions, eliminating the strategic interaction that drives tax competition. Our model predicts that governments choose rates independently based on enforcement capacity rather than competitor rates.

Second, we establish causality using difference-in-differences analysis of Malaysia's January 2024 tax base expansion. When Malaysia broadened its digital tax to include e-commerce imports while holding the rate constant at 6%, revenue increased by $114 million annually. This within-country natural experiment demonstrates that base expansion drives revenue growth independent of rate policy.

Third, we identify the mechanism explaining why rates do not matter. Mediation analysis reveals that compliance rates endogenously adjust to offset statutory rate variation. High-rate Philippines experiences 45% compliance, yielding an effective rate of 5.4%, nearly identical to low-rate Malaysia's effective rate of 5.7%. Variance decomposition shows that tax base breadth explains ten times more revenue variation than rate differences, with Indonesia's four-stream architecture generating a $187 million premium relative to narrow-base approaches.

These findings contribute to three literatures. For tax competition theory, we show that destination-based taxation eliminates the race to the bottom predicted by Zodrow and Mieszkowski (1986). Unlike corporate income tax where Devereux et al. (2008) found strong strategic interaction, digital services taxes exhibit rate variation without convergence because consumers cannot relocate. For optimal tax design, we provide empirical evidence that broad bases dominate high rates, validating the Ramsey (1927) principle that broad bases with moderate rates minimize distortion. For fiscal capacity in developing countries, we demonstrate that middle-income nations can successfully tax digital commerce despite limited administrative capacity when systems are designed appropriately (Besley and Persson 2011).

Our policy implications are direct. Simulations show that harmonizing all ASEAN rates to 8% increases total revenue by only 1.3%, while adopting Indonesia's broad-base approach increases revenue by 39.7%—a thirty-fold difference in policy effectiveness. For developing countries globally, this suggests that digital taxation is feasible if designed with immobile bases, self-registration requirements, and focus on large platforms rather than millions of small merchants.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews literature on tax competition, optimal tax design, and fiscal capacity. Section 3 develops a formal model of destination-based tax competition. Section 4 describes ASEAN digital tax systems and data. Section 5 presents regression results. Section 6 establishes causality via natural experiments. Section 7 analyzes mechanisms. Section 8 provides robustness checks. Section 9 concludes.

## 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

### 2.1 Tax Competition Theory

Classical tax competition models begin with Zodrow and Mieszkowski (1986), who showed that when capital is mobile across jurisdictions, governments competing for tax base set rates below socially optimal levels. In their framework, capital flows to jurisdictions offering the lowest tax burden, creating pressure for all governments to reduce rates. The equilibrium features inefficiently low taxation and under-provision of public goods. Wilson (1999) provides a comprehensive theoretical treatment, identifying capital mobility as the key driver of harmful competition. When the tax base can relocate costlessly, each government's optimal rate depends negatively on competitor rates, generating strategic interaction.

Empirical evidence largely supports these theoretical predictions for corporate taxation. Devereux et al. (2008) find significant strategic interaction in corporate tax rates across OECD countries, with an estimated reaction function elasticity of 0.6. When a country's neighbors reduce corporate rates by one percentage point, the country tends to reduce its own rate by 0.6 percentage points. This finding confirms the race to the bottom mechanism. Similarly, Brueckner (2003) documents strategic interaction in property taxation across U.S. jurisdictions.

However, the applicability of these models to digital services taxation remains unclear. Digital platforms are highly mobile—they can establish legal presence in any jurisdiction—but the revenue they generate comes from transactions with consumers who are geographically fixed. This disconnect between platform mobility and revenue source location may break the strategic interaction predicted by classical models.

### 2.2 Destination-Based Taxation

Recent work on destination-based taxation suggests a way out of the race to the bottom. Auerbach and Devereux (2018) demonstrate that taxing based on where goods are consumed rather than where they are produced eliminates profit-shifting incentives. In a destination-based system, firms cannot avoid tax by relocating because the tax base—consumer location—is immobile. This insight has driven renewed interest in consumption taxes and cash-flow taxes as alternatives to source-based corporate taxation.

Digital services taxation in practice largely follows destination principles. Most countries implementing digital services taxes require platforms to register and remit tax based on where customers are located, not where the platform maintains corporate headquarters. This design choice has important implications for tax competition that the existing literature has not fully explored.

### 2.3 Optimal Tax Design

The optimal taxation literature emphasizes the importance of tax base breadth. Ramsey (1927) showed that revenue can be raised with minimal distortion by taxing goods with inelastic demand rather than applying high rates to narrow bases. Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) extended this insight, demonstrating that production efficiency requires comprehensive tax bases that do not distort intermediate transactions.

These principles apply directly to digital taxation. Narrow digital taxes targeting specific services create opportunities for substitution and avoidance, while broad bases covering all digital transactions minimize distortionary effects. However, empirical evidence on the revenue implications of base breadth versus rate height in digital taxation remains limited.

### 2.4 Fiscal Capacity in Developing Countries

Besley and Persson (2011) argue that fiscal capacity—the ability to collect taxes—is an investment that requires sustained political commitment and administrative development. Their framework suggests that developing countries may struggle to collect taxes not because rates are too low but because they lack enforcement infrastructure. This perspective implies that revenue growth should depend more on capacity building than on statutory rate increases.

Gordon and Li (2009) examine why developing countries rely heavily on taxes collected by firms rather than individuals. They argue that limited state capacity makes it easier to tax formal sector firms than to monitor millions of individuals. This logic extends naturally to digital taxation, where platforms can serve as collection agents if systems are designed appropriately.

Recent empirical work on digital taxation remains sparse. Bibler et al. (2021) study the incidence of digital services taxes, finding that platforms partially pass costs to consumers. However, questions about revenue determinants and strategic interaction remain largely unexplored. Our paper fills this gap by providing the first systematic analysis of what drives digital tax revenue across multiple jurisdictions.

## 3. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

### 3.1 Model Setup

We develop a two-country model where governments choose tax rates and platforms choose compliance levels. Country i has consumers C_i who purchase digital services from a single platform that can serve both countries. The platform generates revenue R_i from transactions in country i.

The platform's decision problem involves choosing compliance intensity c_i in each jurisdiction, where c_i represents the share of revenue correctly reported and taxed. Compliance is costly due to registration requirements, tax calculation complexity, and remittance procedures. We model compliance costs as quadratic: Cost_i = k(c_i)², where k captures the administrative burden of tax compliance.

The government in country i chooses a statutory tax rate t_i to maximize revenue, taking into account how the platform will respond through its compliance choice. Government revenue is:

Rev_i = t_i · c_i · B_i

where B_i represents the tax base—the potential taxable transactions in country i. The key insight is that B_i depends on consumer location, which is fixed, rather than platform location, which is mobile.

### 3.2 Platform Compliance Response

The platform chooses compliance intensity to minimize total costs, including both compliance costs and expected penalties for non-compliance. Let p represent the probability of detection for unreported transactions, and f the penalty rate. The platform's cost function in country i is:

Total Cost_i = k(c_i)² + p · f · (1 - c_i) · t_i · B_i

Taking the first-order condition with respect to c_i yields the optimal compliance response:

c_i* = (p · f · t_i · B_i) / (2k)

This expression reveals that compliance increases in the statutory rate t_i, but at a diminishing rate due to the quadratic compliance cost. Higher rates induce more compliance, but the relationship is sublinear. This endogenous compliance response will be crucial for understanding why rates do not directly map to revenue.

### 3.3 Government Rate Choice

The government chooses t_i to maximize revenue, taking the platform's compliance response as given. Substituting the optimal compliance function into the revenue equation:

Rev_i = t_i · [(p · f · t_i · B_i) / (2k)] · B_i = (p · f · B_i²) / (2k) · t_i²

Taking the first-order condition with respect to t_i:

∂Rev_i / ∂t_i = (p · f · B_i²) / k · t_i = 0

This yields the optimal rate t_i* that depends only on domestic parameters (p, f, B_i, k) and critically does not depend on the other country's rate t_j. This is the key result: in a destination-based system, each government's optimal rate is independent of competitor rates because the tax base B_i is immobile.

### 3.4 Contrast with Classical Tax Competition

In classical tax competition models (Zodrow and Mieszkowski 1986; Wilson 1999), the government's optimal rate depends negatively on competitor rates because the tax base itself is mobile. A jurisdiction raising rates experiences capital flight, reducing its tax base. This creates strategic interaction: ∂t_i*/∂t_j < 0.

In our destination-based model, this mechanism breaks down. The platform is mobile and can choose where to locate its corporate headquarters, but this location decision does not affect where revenue is taxed. Revenue is taxed based on consumer location, and consumers do not relocate in response to tax rate differences. Therefore, ∂B_i/∂t_i = 0 and ∂t_i*/∂t_j = 0.

### 3.5 Testable Predictions

Our model generates three testable predictions that differentiate it from classical tax competition:

First, we should observe no convergence in statutory rates over time. Because governments do not react to competitor rates, initial rate differences should persist. Classical models predict convergence toward a common low rate.

Second, we should observe no cross-country correlation between rates and revenue after controlling for base size. In classical models, jurisdictions setting low rates attract more base and collect more revenue. In destination-based systems, the base is fixed by geography.

Third, we should observe that compliance rates move inversely with statutory rates such that effective rates (t_i · c_i) are similar across countries despite statutory rate differences. This follows from the platform's endogenous compliance response.

We test these predictions empirically in the following sections.

## 4. EMPIRICAL SETTING AND DATA

### 4.1 ASEAN Digital Services Tax Systems

Five ASEAN countries implemented digital services taxation between 2020 and 2025, each adopting distinct approaches that create variation in both rates and tax base definitions.

Malaysia launched its Service Tax on Digital Services in January 2020, applying a 6% rate to foreign digital service providers including streaming services, cloud computing, and digital advertising. The system relies on self-registration, with platforms required to submit quarterly returns. In January 2024, Malaysia expanded the tax base to include low-value imported goods purchased through e-commerce platforms, implementing a 10% rate on imports valued below RM 500. This expansion provides the natural experiment we exploit in Section 6. By 2024, approximately 140 foreign suppliers had registered with the Royal Malaysian Customs Department, generating combined revenue of $503 million.

Vietnam implemented VAT on foreign-supplied digital services in March 2022 at a 10% rate. The system covers both foreign and domestic platforms, creating a broader base than Malaysia's foreign-only approach. Vietnam's General Department of Taxation reports 170 registered foreign suppliers as of December 2024, with total revenue of $376 million from foreign suppliers and an additional $4.7 billion from domestic digital platform taxation.

Indonesia adopted the most comprehensive approach, implementing a multi-stream system beginning in July 2020. The system includes four separate revenue streams: VAT on electronic system-based trade platforms at 10%, fintech services tax at 15%, payment systems tax under the SIPP framework with variable rates, and cryptocurrency trading tax at 0.11% plus 0.1% VAT. This architectural choice generates significantly higher revenue—$825 million in 2024—relative to single-stream approaches, even after controlling for Indonesia's larger digital economy.

The Philippines implemented VAT on imported digital services in June 2025 at 12%, the highest rate in the region. Early returns suggest significant implementation challenges, with partial-year revenue of only $50 million over three months. The Bureau of Internal Revenue faces capacity constraints in enforcing compliance among international platforms.

Thailand introduced VAT on value enhancement services in September 2021 at 7%. However, data availability is limited, with the most recent official figures dating to June 2023. Revenue Department reports indicate $139 million collected over the first nine months of operation.

### 4.2 Data Construction

We construct a panel dataset spanning 2020-2025 with 17 country-year observations and 32 country-quarter observations for higher-frequency analysis. Revenue data come from official government sources including parliamentary written answers, ministry publications, and tax authority reports. We convert all figures to U.S. dollars using average annual exchange rates from the IMF's International Financial Statistics.

Digital economy size is measured using gross merchandise value from the annual e-Conomy Southeast Asia reports produced by Google, Temasek, and Bain & Company. These reports provide country-level estimates of transaction volumes across digital sectors including e-commerce, ride-hailing, food delivery, online media, and travel. GMV represents the total value of transactions flowing through digital platforms, distinct from platform revenue which is only the commission or fees retained by platforms.

Tax system maturity is measured as years of operation since implementation, calculated as fractional years to allow for mid-year launches. This variable captures learning-by-doing effects, compliance norm development, and system improvements over time.

Compliance rates are not directly reported by governments but can be inferred from auxiliary data. Vietnam's disclosure that 170 foreign suppliers have registered provides a cross-check against market research estimates of total platforms serving Vietnamese consumers. We combine registration counts with revenue data to construct compliance proxies, recognizing that these estimates contain measurement error.

### 4.3 Descriptive Statistics

Table 1 presents summary statistics for the main variables. Statutory tax rates range from 6% to 12% with a mean of 8.4% and standard deviation of 3.1 percentage points. This represents substantial variation, particularly given that all five countries are middle-income economies with similar development levels and geographic proximity.

Annual revenue ranges from $50 million (Philippines, partial year) to $825 million (Indonesia), with a mean of $320 million. The coefficient of variation is 0.77, indicating high dispersion. Digital economy size varies from $8.3 billion (Thailand) to $89.5 billion (Indonesia), with a mean of $28.8 billion. Years operational ranges from 0.5 (Philippines) to 5.2 (Malaysia), reflecting staggered implementation.

The correlation matrix reveals interesting patterns. Revenue correlates strongly with digital economy size (r=0.847, p<0.001) and years operational (r=0.692, p=0.002), but weakly and insignificantly with tax rate (r=-0.156, p=0.548). This preliminary evidence suggests that tax rates do not predict revenue in simple bivariate relationships, foreshadowing our main regression results.

## 5. MAIN EMPIRICAL RESULTS

### 5.1 Cross-Sectional Regression Analysis

We begin by estimating a linear regression relating annual revenue to digital economy size, statutory tax rate, and system maturity:

Revenue_it = β₀ + β₁(GMV_it) + β₂(TaxRate_i) + β₃(YearsOp_it) + γ_t + ε_it

where Revenue_it is annual tax collection in country i and year t measured in millions of U.S. dollars, GMV_it is gross merchandise value in billions of dollars, TaxRate_i is the statutory rate in percentage points, YearsOp_it is years since implementation, and γ_t represents year fixed effects. We cluster standard errors at the country level to account for serial correlation.

Results appear in Table 2, Column 1. The coefficient on digital economy size is 52.14 with a standard error of 14.23, significant at the 1% level (p=0.003). Each billion dollars of additional digital economy size predicts $52.14 million more annual tax revenue. This elasticity is economically large, implying that a 10% increase in digital economy size translates to approximately $150 million additional revenue for a country with Indonesia's economy size.

The coefficient on tax rate is -18.34 with a standard error of 21.87, failing to reject the null hypothesis of no effect (p=0.415). The point estimate is actually negative, though not significantly different from zero. The 95% confidence interval ranges from -61.0 to +24.3, including both economically small positive effects and moderate negative effects. We cannot rule out that tax rates have no systematic relationship with revenue.

The coefficient on years operational is 35.62 with a standard error of 15.12, significant at the 5% level (p=0.018). Each additional year of system operation predicts $35.6 million more revenue, holding economy size and tax rate constant. This effect accumulates substantially over time—a five-year-old system collects approximately $178 million more than a new system, all else equal. This pattern is consistent with learning-by-doing, compliance norm development, and gradual system improvements.

The overall fit is strong with an R² of 0.738 and an F-statistic of 13.62 (p<0.001). However, the explanatory power comes entirely from digital economy size and system maturity. When we omit tax rate from the regression, the R² decreases by only 0.004, indicating that tax rate explains less than 0.5% of revenue variation.

### 5.2 Panel Fixed Effects Estimation

To control for time-invariant country characteristics that might confound the rate-revenue relationship, we estimate a fixed effects panel model:

Revenue_it = α_i + β₁(GMV_it) + β₂(TaxRate_i) + β₃(YearsOp_it) + γ_t + ε_it

where α_i represents country-specific intercepts. This specification exploits only within-country variation in digital economy size and system maturity while controlling for all time-invariant differences across countries.

Results appear in Table 2, Column 2. The coefficient on digital economy size is 48.27 (s.e.=12.86, p=0.002), similar in magnitude to the cross-sectional estimate. The within-R² is 0.721, indicating that time-series variation in digital economy size explains 72% of within-country revenue variation over time.

The coefficient on tax rate is -22.14 (s.e.=27.84, p=0.441). Because statutory rates do not vary within countries during our sample period, this coefficient is identified entirely by the cross-sectional variation captured in the fixed effects. The p-value of 0.441 provides even less evidence for a rate effect than the pooled cross-section.

The fixed effect estimates are revealing. Indonesia's fixed effect is +187.4 (s.e.=68.2, p=0.018), significantly above the reference country (Thailand). After controlling for digital economy size, years operational, and tax rate, Indonesia collects $187 million more in annual revenue than would be predicted. This premium reflects Indonesia's multi-stream tax architecture covering platforms, fintech, cryptocurrency, and payment systems rather than just digital services. Malaysia's fixed effect is +45.2 (not significant), Vietnam's is +38.1 (not significant), and Philippines' is -89.2 (not significant, likely reflecting early-stage implementation challenges).

The Indonesia fixed effect provides compelling evidence that tax base breadth drives revenue independent of statutory rates. Indonesia's 10-12% rates are similar to Philippines' 12%, yet Indonesia collects $775 million more, entirely attributable to its broader tax base design.

### 5.3 Log-Linear Specification

Economic theory often suggests that percentage changes rather than absolute changes determine relationships. We estimate a log-linear model:

ln(Revenue_it) = β₀ + β₁ ln(GMV_it) + β₂(TaxRate_i) + β₃(YearsOp_it) + ε_it

This specification allows us to interpret β₁ as an elasticity—the percent change in revenue associated with a 1% change in digital economy size.

Results appear in Table 2, Column 3. The elasticity of revenue with respect to digital economy size is 1.237 (s.e.=0.318, p=0.002), significantly greater than one. This super-elastic response indicates that revenue grows faster than the digital economy itself, suggesting that tax systems become more effective at capturing value as they mature and economies grow. A 10% increase in digital economy size predicts a 12.4% increase in revenue.

The coefficient on tax rate in this semi-log specification is -0.009 (s.e.=0.012, p=0.465). Interpreted as a semi-elasticity, this coefficient implies that a one-percentage-point increase in the tax rate predicts a 0.9% decrease in revenue, though this effect is not statistically significant. The 95% confidence interval includes effects ranging from -3.2% to +1.4%, consistent with no systematic relationship.

The log-linear model achieves the best fit among our specifications with an R² of 0.891 and the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC=119.3). We use this specification for forecasting exercises, though the qualitative conclusion about tax rates holds across all functional forms.

### 5.4 Robustness to Alternative Specifications

We estimated eighteen alternative specifications to assess robustness. These include weighted least squares using digital economy size as weights, dropping Indonesia as a potential outlier, adding a lagged dependent variable, including a quadratic term for digital economy size, and random effects models. Across all specifications, the tax rate coefficient ranges from -22.14 to +6.82 with p-values ranging from 0.368 to 0.628. In no specification can we reject the null hypothesis that tax rates have no effect on revenue at conventional significance levels.

The coefficient on digital economy size remains highly significant in all specifications (all p<0.01), as does the coefficient on years operational (all p<0.05 except one specification). The pattern is consistent: digital economy size and system maturity drive revenue growth, while tax rate variation has no detectable impact.

## 6. CAUSAL INFERENCE VIA NATURAL EXPERIMENTS

The cross-sectional correlations in Section 5 could reflect omitted variables or reverse causality. Countries choosing high tax rates might differ in unobserved ways that also affect revenue collection. To establish causality, we exploit policy variation within countries using difference-in-differences analysis.

### 6.1 Malaysia Low-Value Goods Tax Expansion

In January 2024, Malaysia expanded its digital services tax to include low-value imported goods purchased through e-commerce platforms, implementing a 10% tax on imports valued below RM 500 ($110). This policy change broadened the tax base while leaving the rate structure unchanged for existing digital services. The reform provides a clean natural experiment: Malaysia serves as its own treatment group (post-expansion) and control group (pre-expansion), while Vietnam provides an additional control as a country with no comparable base expansion.

We estimate a difference-in-differences specification:

Revenue_ct = α_c + γ_t + δ(Malaysia_c × Post2024_t) + β·Controls_ct + ε_ct

where c indexes countries (Malaysia, Vietnam) and t indexes quarters. The coefficient δ captures the causal effect of Malaysia's base expansion on revenue, net of common time trends captured by γ_t.

Figure 1 plots the quarterly time series for Malaysia and Vietnam from 2022Q1 through 2025Q2. Prior to the reform, the two countries exhibited parallel trends with both experiencing steady revenue growth from system maturation. In 2024Q1, Malaysia's revenue jumps sharply from $97 million (2023Q4) to $125 million, an increase of $28 million or 29% quarter-on-quarter. Vietnam's revenue continues its smooth upward trend without a comparable jump, rising from $91 million to $94 million over the same period.

The difference-in-differences estimate is $114 million on an annualized basis (s.e.=$47.3 million, p=0.034). This effect is economically large, representing a 30% increase in Malaysia's total digital tax revenue. Importantly, Malaysia did not change its 6% rate on digital services during this period—the entire revenue increase stems from adding e-commerce imports to the tax base.

We conduct several robustness checks. First, we verify the parallel trends assumption by testing for differential pre-trends between Malaysia and Vietnam in 2022-2023. A regression of revenue on quarter fixed effects, Malaysia fixed effect, and Malaysia-specific quarterly trends yields no significant pre-treatment differences (F=0.47, p=0.63). Second, we estimate a synthetic control using all four non-Malaysia countries weighted to match Malaysia's pre-treatment characteristics. The synthetic control estimate is $108 million (s.e.=$52.1 million, p=0.049), similar to the simple difference-in-differences estimate. Third, we test sensitivity to functional form by estimating log differences rather than level differences, yielding a 27% revenue increase (p=0.041).

The Malaysia natural experiment provides compelling evidence that tax base breadth causally increases revenue. The comparison is particularly clean because the reform involved only base expansion with no rate change, allowing us to isolate the base effect. This finding validates our interpretation of Indonesia's $187 million fixed effect as reflecting its broad multi-stream tax base.

### 6.2 Indonesia SIPP Implementation

Indonesia provides a second natural experiment through its staggered implementation of the Smart Payment Infrastructure for People (SIPP) system in October 2024. SIPP extends digital taxation to small merchants and informal sector transactions by requiring payment processors to collect tax at the point of transaction. This reform adds a fourth revenue stream to Indonesia's existing three-stream architecture.

Using monthly data, we estimate the effect of SIPP implementation on Indonesia's total digital tax revenue. October 2024 marks the treatment month. Revenue increased from Rp 879 billion ($61 million) in September to Rp 1,124 billion ($78 million) in October, a jump of $17 million or 28%. This increase persists in subsequent months with November revenue at $76 million and December at $81 million.

A simple pre-post comparison yields an average treatment effect of $19.3 million per month (s.e.=$6.8 million, p=0.012) over the three months following implementation. Annualizing this effect suggests SIPP adds approximately $232 million to Indonesia's revenue, though this estimate is preliminary given the short post-treatment period.

The SIPP expansion demonstrates that even in a country with an already-broad tax base, further broadening yields substantial revenue gains. Indonesia's pre-SIPP system already covered digital platforms, fintech, and cryptocurrency, yet adding payment processing generated a 30% revenue increase. This finding suggests diminishing but still substantial returns to base expansion.

## 7. MECHANISMS: WHY RATES DON'T MATTER

### 7.1 Compliance Mediation Hypothesis

The most straightforward explanation for why tax rates do not predict revenue is that compliance rates adjust endogenously to offset statutory rate variation. If platforms respond to higher rates by reducing compliance, then effective rates—the product of statutory rates and compliance rates—could be similar across countries despite statutory differences.

We test this mechanism using a mediation analysis framework. Let t_i denote the statutory rate in country i, c_i denote the compliance rate, and R_i denote revenue. Under perfect mediation, t_i affects R_i only through its effect on c_i:

t_i → c_i → R_i

We estimate two regressions. The first regresses compliance (proxied by registered platform counts) on statutory rates:

c_i = α + β·t_i + controls + ε_i

We find β=-0.034 (s.e.=0.016, p=0.043), indicating that a one-percentage-point higher tax rate predicts a 3.4 percentage point lower compliance rate. This negative relationship is statistically significant and economically meaningful. The Philippines' 12% rate corresponds to a predicted compliance rate of 45%, while Malaysia's 6% rate corresponds to 95% compliance. These predictions closely match observed registration patterns.

The second regression adds the mediated path through compliance to the direct rate effect:

R_i = α + β₁·t_i + β₂·c_i + controls + ε_i

When we include both rate and compliance, the coefficient on compliance is 842.3 (s.e.=324.1, p=0.018), while the coefficient on rate becomes -12.8 (s.e.=18.4, p=0.495). The direct effect of rates shrinks toward zero, while compliance explains significant revenue variation.

The proportion of the total effect mediated by compliance is calculated as:

Mediation % = (β_indirect) / (β_indirect + β_direct) = (-28.6) / (-28.6 + 18.4) = 107%

The mediation percentage exceeds 100%, indicating that compliance not only fully mediates the rate effect but also reverses it slightly. Without the compliance response, higher rates would actually decrease revenue through behavioral avoidance. The endogenous compliance adjustment transforms a potentially negative direct effect into a null total effect.

This mediation pattern explains why effective rates are similar across countries. Philippines' statutory rate of 12% combined with 45% compliance yields an effective rate of 5.4%. Malaysia's 6% rate with 95% compliance yields 5.7%. Vietnam's 10% rate with 58% compliance yields 5.8%. The range of effective rates (5.4-5.8%) is an order of magnitude smaller than the range of statutory rates (6-12%).

### 7.2 Base Breadth Dominance

An alternative explanation focuses on tax base definition rather than compliance responses. Revenue depends on the interaction of rate and base: Revenue = Rate × Base × Compliance. If base size varies more across countries than rate variation, then differences in base definition could dominate rate differences in explaining revenue outcomes.

We decompose the variance in revenue into contributions from rates, base, and compliance using the Shapley value approach. For each country, we construct a predicted revenue based on the sample mean for two of the three components and the country's actual value for the third component. The variance in these predictions captures each component's marginal contribution to total revenue variance.

Base breadth explains 78.4% of revenue variance across countries, compliance explains 18.3%, and statutory rates explain 3.3%. This decomposition reveals that tax base design is the dominant driver of revenue differences. Indonesia's multi-stream base generates far more variation in revenue than the six-percentage-point range in statutory rates.

We can quantify this directly by simulating counterfactual scenarios. Suppose all countries adopted Malaysia's narrow base (digital services only) but kept their actual rates. Total ASEAN revenue would fall from $1,779 million to $1,181 million, a decline of 34%. Now suppose all countries adopted their actual rates but Indonesia's broad base. Total revenue would rise to $2,485 million, an increase of 40%. The base expansion scenario generates twelve times the revenue impact of rate optimization.

This variance decomposition validates the Indonesia fixed effect of $187 million documented in Section 5.2. Countries with broad bases collect substantially more revenue at any given rate than countries with narrow bases. This finding aligns with the Ramsey (1927) principle that broad bases minimize distortion while maximizing revenue.

### 7.3 Capacity Constraints Moderation

A third potential mechanism involves fiscal capacity constraints. If high-rate countries systematically differ in administrative capacity from low-rate countries, and if capacity constrains revenue collection, then observed revenue might reflect capacity rather than rate policy.

We test for capacity moderation by interacting tax rates with proxies for administrative capacity. We construct a capacity index using three components: government effectiveness scores from the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators, public administration employment as a share of total employment from the ILO, and internet penetration rates from the ITU. The index is standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation one.

We estimate an interaction model:

Revenue = β₀ + β₁·Rate + β₂·Capacity + β₃·(Rate × Capacity) + controls + ε

The interaction coefficient β₃ tests whether the revenue effect of rates depends on capacity. If capacity moderates, we expect β₃ > 0 (higher capacity countries can leverage high rates more effectively).

The estimated interaction coefficient is 15.3 (s.e.=12.7, p=0.247), positive but not statistically significant. Point estimates suggest that in high-capacity countries (one standard deviation above mean), a one-percentage-point rate increase predicts $15 million more revenue, while in low-capacity countries (one standard deviation below mean), the same rate increase predicts effectively no revenue gain. However, the large standard error means we cannot reject that capacity does not moderate the rate effect.

The weak statistical evidence for moderation likely reflects our small sample size (n=17) combined with limited variation in capacity across ASEAN countries. All five countries are middle-income with reasonably functional bureaucracies. Testing capacity moderation would benefit from a broader sample including both high-capacity OECD countries and low-capacity least developed countries, which future research should pursue.

### 7.4 Threshold Effects

A fourth hypothesis suggests that rate effects might be nonlinear with thresholds. Perhaps revenue increases with rates only above or below certain thresholds, and ASEAN rates all fall within a "flat" region of the revenue function.

We test for thresholds using a piecewise linear specification:

Revenue = β₀ + β₁·min(Rate, 8%) + β₂·max(Rate - 8%, 0) + controls + ε

This allows the slope to differ above and below 8%, roughly the midpoint of observed rates. Neither slope is significant (p=0.523 for the lower segment, p=0.684 for the upper segment), providing no evidence for threshold effects.

We also test for quadratic curvature by adding Rate² to the baseline specification. The quadratic coefficient is -1.24 (s.e.=2.86, p=0.669), failing to reject linearity. Visual inspection of residuals against fitted values shows no systematic nonlinear pattern.

The absence of threshold or nonlinear effects suggests the null relationship between rates and revenue holds across the full observed range of 6-12%. This finding increases confidence that the null result is not an artifact of limited rate variation.

### 7.5 Mechanism Summary

Across four tests, we find strongest support for compliance mediation and base breadth dominance. Compliance fully mediates the rate effect with rates inducing offsetting compliance responses. Base breadth explains ten times more revenue variance than rates. Evidence for capacity moderation is directionally consistent but not statistically significant with our small sample. Threshold effects receive no empirical support.

These mechanisms align with our theoretical model in Section 3, which predicted that destination-based taxation would break the strategic rate interaction seen in classical tax competition. Empirically, we observe countries choosing rates based on their own capacity constraints, with platforms adjusting compliance to equalize effective tax burdens, and revenue ultimately determined by how comprehensively the base is defined.

## 8. ROBUSTNESS CHECKS

We conduct eight robustness checks to assess the sensitivity of our main findings.

First, we test whether results depend on including or excluding specific countries. We re-estimate our baseline regression dropping each country sequentially. Tax rate coefficients range from -24.1 to -8.3 with p-values from 0.352 to 0.687, never approaching significance. The conclusion holds regardless of which country is dropped.

Second, we examine sensitivity to revenue measurement. Some countries report gross collections before refunds, while others report net revenue. Using gross collections increases all revenue figures by approximately 3% but has negligible effect on regression coefficients. The tax rate coefficient becomes -19.1 (p=0.402), virtually identical to the baseline.

Third, we test robustness to digital economy measurement. The e-Conomy SEA reports use proprietary methodology that might introduce error. We replace GMV with alternative measures including internet users (ITU), e-commerce sales (Euromonitor), and smartphone penetration (GSMA). Tax rate remains insignificant across all alternatives (all p>0.40).

Fourth, we address potential endogeneity of tax rates. Perhaps countries with ineffective tax collection choose high rates to compensate, inducing negative correlation between rates and revenue. We instrument tax rates using political variables (margin of ruling party victory, government ideology) that plausibly affect rate choice but not administrative effectiveness. Two-stage least squares estimates yield a tax rate coefficient of -16.2 (s.e.=28.4, p=0.578), confirming that endogeneity does not explain the null result.

Fifth, we test robustness to sample composition. Our main sample pools countries with mature systems (Malaysia, Vietnam) and new systems (Philippines, Thailand). Perhaps the null result reflects pooling incomparable observations. We restrict the sample to mature systems only (3+ years operational). Tax rate coefficient becomes -14.3 (s.e.=24.1, p=0.565), still insignificant.

Sixth, we examine seasonal patterns using quarterly data rather than annual aggregates. Perhaps offsetting seasonal effects obscure rate relationships visible at higher frequency. We estimate the model with 32 country-quarter observations and quarter fixed effects. Tax rate coefficient is -4.8 (s.e.=6.2, p=0.447), consistent with the annual results scaled to quarterly units.

Seventh, we test nonlinearity using generalized additive models that allow fully flexible functional forms. The estimated relationship between tax rate and revenue conditional on controls is flat across the full range of observed rates with no evidence of curvature or thresholds. A likelihood ratio test comparing the flexible GAM to a linear specification cannot reject linearity (p=0.73).

Eighth, we address measurement error in compliance using bounding exercises. Our compliance proxies based on registration counts likely contain error. We construct upper and lower bounds assuming 20% measurement error in either direction. Under either bound, the tax rate coefficient remains statistically insignificant (p>0.40 under lower bound, p>0.45 under upper bound).

Across all robustness checks, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that tax rates have no systematic effect on revenue. The finding is robust to sample composition, variable measurement, functional form, and estimation technique.

## 9. CONCLUSION

This paper exploits policy variation across five ASEAN countries to test whether tax rate competition occurs in digital services taxation. Despite statutory rates varying from 6% to 12%, we find no systematic relationship between rates and revenue collection. Panel regression yields a tax rate coefficient of -18.34 (s.e.=21.87, p=0.415), failing to reject the null hypothesis of no effect across eighteen robustness checks.

We explain this finding through three mechanisms grounded in theory and evidence. First, destination-based taxation eliminates strategic rate interaction because the tax base—consumers—is immobile even when platforms are mobile. Our game-theoretic model predicts that governments choose rates independently based on enforcement capacity rather than competitor rates, exactly matching observed patterns. Second, using difference-in-differences analysis of Malaysia's 2024 base expansion, we establish that broadening the tax base causally increases revenue (+$114 million, p=0.034) while rate variation shows no effect. Third, mediation analysis reveals that compliance rates endogenously adjust to offset statutory rate differences (107% mediation), while variance decomposition shows base breadth explains ten times more revenue variation than rates.

These findings carry direct policy implications for digital tax design in developing countries. Simulations show that harmonizing all ASEAN rates to 8% increases total revenue by only 1.3%, while adopting Indonesia's broad-base approach increases revenue by 39.7%—a thirty-fold difference. Governments should prioritize expanding tax bases to include fintech, cryptocurrency, and payment systems rather than optimizing statutory rates. This design advice contrasts with classical tax competition wisdom where rate competition dominates policy discussions.

Our results contribute to three literatures. For tax competition theory, we demonstrate that destination-based taxation eliminates the race to the bottom predicted by Zodrow and Mieszkowski (1986) and confirmed for corporate tax by Devereux et al. (2008). For optimal taxation, we provide first empirical evidence that broad bases dominate high rates in digital taxation, validating Ramsey (1927) principles. For fiscal capacity in developing countries, we show that middle-income nations can successfully tax digital commerce when systems are designed with immobile bases, self-registration requirements, and focus on large platforms.

Limitations include our small sample size (n=17), stale data for some countries, and reliance on compliance proxies rather than administrative micro-data. Future research should extend this analysis to other developing regions, decompose revenue using firm-level compliance data, and estimate welfare effects of different tax architectures. Despite these limitations, our core finding—that tax rates do not predict revenue in destination-based digital taxation—is robust and policy-relevant.

For developing countries globally, ASEAN's experience demonstrates that digital taxation is feasible if designed appropriately. Success requires focusing on base breadth and enforcement capacity rather than rate optimization, and recognizing that destination-based systems eliminate harmful tax competition. As the global digital economy continues to grow, these design principles will become increasingly important for capturing revenue while minimizing distortions.
