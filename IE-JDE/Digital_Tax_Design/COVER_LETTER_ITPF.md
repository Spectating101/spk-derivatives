Dear Professor [Editor Name],

I am pleased to submit for your consideration my manuscript titled **"Digital Services Taxation Without Tax Competition: Evidence from ASEAN Policy Variation"** (approximately 12,000 words, 6 tables, 8 figures) for publication in International Tax and Public Finance.

## Contribution

This paper exploits policy variation across five ASEAN countries (2020-2025) to test whether classical tax competition occurs in digital services taxation. Despite statutory rates varying from 6% to 12%, I find no systematic relationship between rates and revenue (β=-18.34, p=0.415). This finding is robust across 18 specification checks and persists in causal difference-in-differences analysis of Malaysia's 2024 tax base expansion.

## Three Contributions to ITPF Literature

**First**, I develop a game-theoretic model showing that destination-based taxation eliminates strategic rate interaction because the tax base (consumers) is immobile. The Nash equilibrium predicts rate variation without convergence—exactly what I observe empirically. This contrasts sharply with corporate income tax where Devereux et al. (2008) found strong strategic interaction (elasticity 0.6). The difference lies in tax base mobility.

**Second**, I establish causality using natural experiments. Malaysia's January 2024 Low-Value Goods tax addition generated a $114 million revenue increase (p=0.034) while holding the rate constant at 6%, demonstrating that base expansion, not rate optimization, drives revenue growth.

**Third**, I identify mechanisms explaining why rates don't matter. Mediation analysis reveals that compliance rates endogenously adjust to offset statutory rate variation (107% full mediation, p=0.043), while variance decomposition shows base breadth explains 10 times more revenue variation than rate differences.

## Why ITPF

This manuscript is particularly appropriate for ITPF given the journal's focus on international taxation, policy design, and developing country fiscal capacity. The ASEAN setting provides a natural laboratory—five countries, same region, same timeframe, five distinct approaches—generating insights impossible from single-country or cross-regional studies.

The policy implication is direct and actionable: developing countries should expand tax bases (adding fintech, cryptocurrency, payments) rather than optimize rates, as simulations show base-broadening yields 30× more revenue than rate harmonization.

## Submission Details

The manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration at another journal. All data sources are publicly available government reports (Malaysia Parliamentary answers, Vietnam GDT reports, Indonesia Ministry of Finance statements), and I will provide full replication code upon acceptance. I have no conflicts of interest to declare.

## Suggested Reviewers

I suggest the following potential reviewers who are experts in tax competition, digital taxation, and developing country fiscal policy:

1. **Prof. Michael Keen** (London School of Economics) – Tax competition theory expert
2. **Prof. Wei Cui** (University of British Columbia) – Digital services taxation specialist  
3. **Prof. Joel Slemrod** (University of Michigan) – Tax compliance and enforcement
4. **Prof. Henrik Kleven** (Princeton University) – VAT and developing country taxation

## Preemptive Responses to Likely Concerns

**Concern 1**: "Sample is too small (n=17)"  
**Response**: Acknowledged explicitly in limitations (Section 9). Power analysis shows we can rule out large effects. Robustness to jackknife/outliers demonstrates reliability. DiD uses quarterly data (n=32), increasing power.

**Concern 2**: "Results are ASEAN-specific"  
**Response**: ASEAN represents 680M people, 75% of SE Asia GDP. Mechanisms (compliance, base breadth) are general. Theory applies to all destination-based digital taxes. Discuss implications for other developing regions (Africa, Latin America).

**Concern 3**: "Indonesia is driving results"  
**Response**: Jackknife dropping Indonesia: β=-21.5, p=0.428 (results unchanged). Indonesia effect isolated via fixed effects (+$187M premium). Multi-stream advantage confirmed by Malaysia LVG DiD (+$114M).

Thank you for considering this submission. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
