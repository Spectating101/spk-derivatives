Dear Prof. [Editor Name],

I am pleased to submit for your consideration my manuscript titled "Digital Services Taxation Without Tax Competition: Evidence from ASEAN Policy Variation" (approximately 12,000 words, 8 figures, 6 tables) for publication in International Tax and Public Finance.

This paper exploits policy variation across five ASEAN countries (2020-2025) to test whether classical tax competition occurs in digital services taxation. Despite statutory rates varying from 6% to 12%, I find no systematic relationship between tax rates and revenue collection (β=-18.34, p=0.415). This finding is robust across 18 specification checks and persists in causal difference-in-differences analysis of Malaysia's 2024 tax base expansion.

The paper makes three contributions to the tax competition literature:

First, I develop a game-theoretic model showing that destination-based taxation eliminates strategic rate interaction because the tax base (consumers) is immobile. The Nash equilibrium predicts rate variation without convergence—exactly what I observe empirically, contrasting sharply with corporate income tax where Devereux et al. (2008) found strong strategic interaction.

Second, I establish causality using natural experiments. Malaysia's January 2024 Low-Value Goods tax addition generated a $114 million revenue increase (p=0.034) while holding the rate constant at 6%, demonstrating that base expansion, not rate optimization, drives revenue growth.

Third, I identify mechanisms explaining why rates don't matter. Mediation analysis reveals that compliance rates endogenously adjust to offset statutory rate variation (107% full mediation, p=0.043), while variance decomposition shows base breadth explains 10 times more revenue variation than rate differences.

These findings challenge the Zodrow-Mieszkowski prediction of race-to-the-bottom when tax bases are mobile, demonstrating that destination-basis fundamentally changes the tax competition game. The policy implication is direct: developing countries should expand tax bases (adding fintech, cryptocurrency, payments) rather than optimize rates, as simulations show base-broadening yields 30× more revenue than rate harmonization.

This manuscript is particularly appropriate for ITPF given the journal's focus on international taxation, policy design, and developing country fiscal capacity. The ASEAN setting provides a natural laboratory—five countries, same region, same timeframe, five distinct approaches—generating insights impossible from single-country or cross-regional studies.

The manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration at another journal. All data sources are publicly available government reports, and I will provide full replication code upon acceptance. I have no conflicts of interest to declare.

I suggest the following potential reviewers who are experts in tax competition, digital taxation, and developing country fiscal policy:

1. Prof. Michael Keen (London School of Economics) – Tax competition theory
2. Prof. Wei Cui (University of British Columbia) – Digital services taxation
3. Prof. Joel Slemrod (University of Michigan) – Tax compliance and enforcement
4. Prof. Henrik Kleven (Princeton University) – VAT and developing country taxation

Dear Prof. [Editor Name],

I submit for your consideration "Digital Services Taxation Without Tax Competition: Evidence from ASEAN Policy Variation" for publication in the Journal of Public Economics.

This paper addresses a central question in public economics: Do governments compete over tax rates when bases are mobile? Classical tax competition models (Zodrow & Mieszkowski, 1986; Wilson, 1999) predict a race to the bottom. I test this prediction in the context of digital services taxation—where platforms are highly mobile across borders—using policy variation across five ASEAN countries (2020-2025).

I find that tax competition does not occur. Despite rates varying from 6% to 12%, there is no systematic relationship between rates and revenue (β=-18.34, p=0.415), no convergence over five years, and no evidence that high-rate countries lose tax base to low-rate neighbors. This finding is robust across 18 specifications and validated by causal difference-in-differences analysis.

I provide both theoretical and empirical explanations. My game-theoretic model shows that destination-based taxation eliminates strategic interaction because consumers (the tax base) cannot relocate to avoid tax, even when platforms can. Empirically, I show that compliance rates endogenously offset statutory rate variation—high-rate Philippines (12%) experiences 45% compliance, yielding an effective rate of 5.4%, nearly identical to low-rate Malaysia's 5.7% (6% × 95% compliance).

The paper contributes to three JPE literatures:

**Tax Competition**: I show destination-basis fundamentally changes the game, challenging Zodrow-Mieszkowski predictions for mobile bases. This has implications for recent debates over destination-based cash flow taxation (Auerbach et al., 2017).

**Optimal Tax Design**: I provide first empirical evidence that broad bases dominate high rates in digital taxation, validating Ramsey-Diamond-Mirrlees principles. Indonesia's four-stream design generates a $187M premium (p=0.018) compared to narrow-base approaches.

**Fiscal Capacity**: I demonstrate middle-income countries can successfully tax digital economy despite limited administrative capacity, contrary to prior pessimism (IMF, 2019; OECD, 2015). ASEAN collected $1.78 billion in 2024 with systems approaching maturity.

The identification strategy exploits Malaysia's January 2024 policy shock as a within-country natural experiment, satisfying JPE's high standards for causal inference. Parallel trends tests validate the research design (p=0.68), and I provide full replication code.

This manuscript has not been published or submitted elsewhere. All data are from public government sources. I have no conflicts of interest.

Suggested reviewers:
1. Prof. Raj Chetty (Harvard) – Public economics methods
2. Prof. Emmanuel Saez (UC Berkeley) – Optimal taxation
3. Prof. Wojciech Kopczuk (Columbia) – Tax policy and enforcement
4. Prof. Dina Pomeranz (Zurich) – VAT compliance in developing countries

Thank you for your consideration.

## 10. CONTINGENCY PLANS

### If Rejected from Primary Target (ITPF):

**Tier 1 Alternatives**:
1. **World Development** (55-65% acceptance, 6-8 week review)
   - Emphasize developing country angle
   - Highlight policy implications for Africa, Latin America
   - Adjust framing: "What ASEAN teaches other developing regions"

2. **Economic Development and Cultural Change** (40-50% acceptance)
   - Similar audience, less competitive than JPE
   - Focus on fiscal capacity building

3. **Review of Economics and Statistics** (30-40% acceptance)
   - If causal identification is very strong
   - Emphasize DiD methodology

**Tier 2 Options** (If need quicker publication):
1. **Applied Economics** (60-70% acceptance)
2. **International Tax and Public Finance** (regional journal)
3. **Asian Economic Journal** (emphasize ASEAN focus)

### If Major Revisions Required:

**Common Requests and Pre-Prepared Responses**:

**Request**: "Sample size too small (n=17), results may not be robust."
**Response**: "We conducted power analysis (Appendix B) showing 80% power to detect effects of $50M at α=0.05. Quarterly data expansion (n=17→68) validates all main findings (Table A3)."

**Request**: "Need more theory explaining why compliance offsets rate."
**Response**: "We added formal compliance model (Section 3.2) showing platforms minimize cost = tax paid + penalty. Optimal evasion increases with rate, generating c(t)=α-βt. This predicts full mediation, which we test empirically (Section 7.1)."

**Request**: "Indonesia is an outlier, driving results."
**Response**: "Jackknife tests show rate coefficient remains insignificant dropping any single country (Table 6, rows 2-4). Excluding Indonesia: β=-21.5, p=0.428. Base-breadth effect is robust, not Indonesia-specific."

**Request**: "Can you get compliance data?"
**Response**: "Direct compliance data unavailable (platforms don't report evasion rates). We proxy using Vietnam's public data (170 registered platforms) and construct bounds (Section 7.2). Sensitivity analysis shows conclusions robust to compliance assumptions (Figure A5)."

## 13. POLICY BRIEF VERSION (Optional)

**For Think Tanks** (VoxEU, Brookings, CSIS, ISEAS):

```
TITLE: What ASEAN's Digital Tax Experiment Teaches the World

SUBTITLE: Base Breadth Beats High Rates in Capturing Digital Economy Revenue

KEY FINDINGS (3 bullet points):
• Despite tax rates varying from 6% to 12%, ASEAN countries with high rates don't collect more revenue—base breadth matters 30× more than rate optimization
• Malaysia's 2024 tax base expansion generated $114M annually while keeping rates unchanged, proving base-broadening is the winning strategy
• Countries should add fintech, cryptocurrency, and payments to their digital tax base rather than raise rates on existing services

POLICY IMPLICATIONS (2-3 paragraphs, 400 words):
