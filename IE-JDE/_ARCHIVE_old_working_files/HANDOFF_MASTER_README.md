## Two Complete Research Papers Ready for Final Generation

**Date**: December 11, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Both papers 90-95% complete, ready for Claude Web to finalize
**Your Task**: Give these handoff documents to Claude Web (claude.ai) for final manuscript generation

## 🎯 WHAT YOU HAVE

You have **TWO distinct research papers**, each 90-95% complete:

### **Paper A: Digital Tax Policy** ("Digital Services Taxation Without Tax Competition")
- **Topic**: Why tax rates don't predict digital tax revenue in ASEAN
- **Finding**: Rates don't matter (p=0.415); base breadth dominates 30:1
- **Method**: Game theory + Causal DiD + 18 robustness checks
- **Target**: International Tax & Public Finance (Tier 1 academic journal)
- **Status**: 95% complete - needs integration of 6 component files
- **Handoff Document**: `HANDOFF_TO_CLAUDE_WEB_PAPER_A.md`

### **Paper B: Invisible Economy** ("The Invisible Ledger")
- **Topic**: Measuring ASEAN's unmeasured digital economy
- **Finding**: $83B invisible wedge, 12.5× fiscal multiplier
- **Method**: Forensic accounting using audited SEC/IDX filings
- **Target**: VoxEU (policy brief, fast) OR World Development (academic journal, slower)
- **Status**: 90% complete - full manuscript exists, needs formatting/expansion
- **Handoff Document**: `HANDOFF_TO_CLAUDE_WEB_PAPER_B.md`

## 📋 HOW TO USE THESE HANDOFFS

### Step 1: Choose Which Paper to Do First
**Recommendation**: Start with **Paper B** (faster, easier, your original thesis)

**Why Paper B first?**
- Already a complete manuscript (just needs formatting)
- Faster publication (VoxEU = 4-6 weeks)
- Your original research question ("How big is the invisible economy?")
- Less work for Claude Web (1-2 hours vs. 2-3 hours)

### Step 2: Go to Claude Web
- Open: https://claude.ai
- Start new conversation
- Upload the handoff document (HANDOFF_TO_CLAUDE_WEB_PAPER_B.md)

### Step 3: Give Claude Web This Prompt

```
I have a research paper that's 90% complete. I need you to finalize it for submission.

I'm uploading a handoff document that contains:
- The complete current manuscript
- All data and findings
- Instructions for what to do
- Target venue options

Please read the handoff document carefully and follow the instructions to generate the final manuscript.

For Paper B specifically: I want to submit to VoxEU (policy brief format), not World Development. Please format the existing 3,500-word manuscript for VoxEU submission, add pull-quote boxes, and create the cover letter.

[Upload: HANDOFF_TO_CLAUDE_WEB_PAPER_B.md]
```

### Step 4: Review Claude Web's Output
- Check that it preserved all your findings
- Verify the data matches what's in the handoff
- Make any small edits needed
- Submit to the journal!

### Step 5: Repeat for Paper A (After Paper B is submitted)
- Same process, but use `HANDOFF_TO_CLAUDE_WEB_PAPER_A.md`
- This one takes longer (2-3 hours for Claude Web) because it's integration work

- Change the findings or data (they're validated)
- Skip the review step (always check Claude Web's output)
- Submit both papers to the same journal (they're different topics)

**IF CLAUDE WEB ASKS FOR CLARIFICATION**:
- Point it back to the handoff document ("Please refer to section X of the handoff")
- If data is missing, check the source files listed in handoff
- If truly stuck, come back to Claude Code for help
