## REVENUE DATA COMPILATION METHODOLOGY

### Data Collection Process

**Step 1: Primary Source Search**
- Identify official government tax/revenue agencies per country
- Locate annual reports, press releases, regulatory documents
- Record official figures with publication dates

**Step 2: Cross-Verification**
- Locate 2-3 secondary sources (news, financial reports, NGO data)
- Compare figures for consistency
- Flag discrepancies; investigate reasons

**Step 3: Confidence Rating**
- Assign confidence level (70%-99%) based on:
  - Source authority (government > news > estimates)
  - Data recency (current year > historical)
  - Consistency across sources
  - Methodology transparency

**Step 4: Documentation**
- Record exact figures, sources, publication dates
- Note any assumptions or extrapolations
- Flag data gaps and limitations

### Confidence Level Assignment

```
99%: Official government agency, published report, recent, verified
98%: Official government agency, multiple corroborating sources
95%: Official data + news verification, minor discrepancies resolved
90%: Official + 2+ secondary sources, methodology clear
85%: Multiple sources with >10% variance; best estimate used
80%: Limited sources; some extrapolation required
75%: New system; incomplete data; annualized from partial year
70%: Significant gaps; estimates based on peer analogies
```

## DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT BY COUNTRY

### Malaysia: **99% Confidence**
✅ Excellent data quality  
✅ Official IRB figures published regularly  
✅ Complete time series 2020-2024  
✅ Cross-verified with multiple sources  
✅ Policy documentation comprehensive

---

### Vietnam: **98% Confidence**
✅ Strong official government reporting  
✅ GDT quarterly data release cycle

---

### Indonesia: **92% Confidence** (down from 95% due to SIPP)
✅ PMSE revenue well-documented (2020+)  
✅ Fintech tax revenue clear (2021+)  
✅ DJP annual reports comprehensive  
⚠️ SIPP data only 3 months old (Oct-Dec 2024); preliminary figures  
⚠️ Crypto tax methodology complex; conservative estimates  
⚠️ Four streams create complexity; integration challenges

⚠️ Very new system (June 2025); only 4 months operational  
⚠️ Limited official data release; mostly preliminary figures  
✅ BIR announcements available  
✅ Policy well-documented  
❌ No full-year baseline; annualized from 3 months  
❌ Compliance ramp-up not yet complete  

**Risk**: High; recommend revisiting forecasts Q1 2026 with full-year 2025 data

---

### Thailand: **70% Confidence** (DATA GAP)
❌ Last official data: June 2023 (18+ months old)  
❌ No confirmed 2024-2025 figures  
⚠️ Forecasts based on peer analogy (Malaysia/Vietnam similarity)
