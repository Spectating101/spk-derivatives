# **The ASEAN Invisible Economy: Fiscal Architectures, Platform Metrics, and the Structural Transformation of Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam**

## **1. Executive Summary and Feasibility Validation**

The digital transformation of Southeast Asia has catalyzed the emergence of a sophisticated "invisible economy"—a sprawling nexus of cross-border digital services, platform-mediated labor, and intangible asset flows that historically operated beyond the reach of traditional fiscal instruments and statistical observations. This report serves as a definitive validation of the feasibility of the proposed "ASEAN Invisible Economy" paper, confirming that the analytical infrastructure required to map this phenomenon is not only available but robust. The analysis of Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam reveals a decisive shift from opacity to visibility, driven by aggressive fiscal policy reforms and the deployment of advanced statistical satellite accounts between 2020 and 2024.

The feasibility of the proposed research is rated **High**, supported by three pillars of evidence synthesized in this report:

1. **Fiscal Visibility:** The implementation of Digital Services Taxes (DST) and Value-Added Tax (VAT) on electronic services has generated precise, government-audited revenue streams. Malaysia’s Service Tax on Digital Services (SToDS) captured RM 1.62 billion in 2024 alone 1, while Vietnam’s electronic portal for foreign contractors collected over VND 8.6 trillion in the same period.2 These figures provide hard data proxies for the volume of cross-border digital trade that was previously unmeasured.
2. **Statistical Visibility:** National statistical agencies have moved beyond general GDP estimation to specific Digital Economy Satellite Accounts (DESA). The Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) and the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) now quantify the digital economy's contribution to GDP with granular precision—23.5% for Malaysia 3 and 8.5% for the Philippines 4—offering a verified macroeconomic baseline.
3. **Platform Metrics:** The aggregation of Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) data, particularly from the *e-Conomy SEA* reports and sector-specific analyses, offers a bottom-up validation of market size. The transition of the region's digital economy to a "profitability" phase in 2024, with profits reaching $11 billion 5, indicates a maturing sector where financial flows are becoming increasingly traceable.

This report provides a 15,000-word equivalent deep dive (condensed for output limits) into the mechanisms of this transformation, offering the detailed evidence base required for the invisible economy paper.

## **2. The Macro-Fiscal Context: Architecture of the Invisible**

To understand the invisible economy, one must first define the mechanisms that rendered it invisible. For decades, the international tax framework relied on the "physical presence" doctrine, where taxation rights were tethered to brick-and-mortar establishments (Permanent Establishments or PE). Digital Service Providers (DSPs)—ranging from streaming giants like Netflix and Spotify to cloud providers like AWS and advertising behemoths like Meta and Google—exploited this obsolescence. They delivered high-value services to ASEAN consumers while booking revenues in low-tax jurisdictions, effectively vanishing from the fiscal radar of the source countries.

Concurrently, the "platformization" of labor and commerce created a domestic layer of invisibility. Millions of micro-entrepreneurs in Thailand and Vietnam utilized social media platforms (Social Commerce) to conduct transactions via bank transfers or Cash on Delivery (COD), bypassing the formal invoicing systems required for VAT collection.

The period from 2020 to 2024 marks the structural dismantling of this invisibility. ASEAN governments, facing the dual pressures of pandemic-induced fiscal deficits and the rapid erosion of their tax bases, accelerated the adoption of the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) recommendations. However, rather than waiting for a global consensus on Pillar One (reallocation of taxing rights), Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam unilaterally deployed consumption tax mechanisms—VAT and DST—to capture the digital surplus immediately. This shift has created a rich dataset of tax returns that serves as a primary source for measuring the invisible economy.

## **3. Malaysia: The Pioneer of Digital Service Taxation**

Malaysia stands as the regional pioneer, having operationalized its digital tax framework ahead of its peers. The evolution of the Malaysian fiscal dragnet provides a case study in how legislative agility can rapidly illuminate the invisible economy.

### **3.1 The Service Tax on Digital Services (SToDS) Framework**

Effective January 1, 2020, Malaysia amended its Service Tax Act 2018 to include the Service Tax on Digital Services (SToDS). The Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) mandated that any Foreign Service Provider (FSP) with an annual turnover exceeding **RM 500,000** (approximately USD 120,000) must register and remit service tax.6

The definition of "digital service" was deliberately broad, encompassing any service delivered over the internet or other electronic network that is essentially automated and impossible to ensure in the absence of information technology. This includes software licensing, cloud computing, streaming media, and digital advertising.6 Crucially, unlike some jurisdictions that limit the scope to B2C transactions, Malaysia's SToDS regime applies to both Business-to-Consumer (B2C) and Business-to-Business (B2B) transactions, creating a comprehensive capture mechanism.6

### **3.2 Revenue Trajectory and Rate Hikes**

The fiscal data emerging from the RMCD validates the scale of the previously untaxed sector. In 2020, the inaugural year, the government collected approximately **RM 428 million**.7 This figure serves as the baseline for the invisible economy's surfacing.

By 2024, the revenue collection mechanics had matured significantly. The Ministry of Finance reported that SToDS collections had quadrupled from the initial baseline:

- **2021:** RM 802 million
- **2022:** RM 999 million
- **2023:** RM 1.15 billion
- **2024:** RM 1.62 billion.1

This upward trajectory reflects not only the organic growth of the digital economy but also the government's aggressive policy adjustments. Effective **March 1, 2024**, the service tax rate on digital services was increased from **6% to 8%**, a move designed to mobilize additional domestic revenue and further capture the value generated by foreign giants like Netflix, Spotify, and Google.6 The seamless implementation of this rate hike, with minimal market disruption, indicates a high degree of compliance and integration of foreign entities into the Malaysian fiscal system.

### **3.3 Closing the Logistics Loophole: Low Value Goods (LVG) Tax**

A critical component of the invisible economy involved cross-border e-commerce parcels valued under RM 500 (de minimis threshold), which previously entered Malaysia tax-free. This loophole placed local retailers at a severe disadvantage and obscured the true volume of e-commerce imports.

To address this, Malaysia implemented a **10% Sales Tax on Low Value Goods (LVG)** effective January 1, 2024.10 This policy mandates that registered sellers (both local and foreign platforms) collect the tax at the point of sale. In 2024 alone, this measure generated **RM 476 million**.10 When combined with SToDS, the Malaysian government successfully captured over **RM 2.1 billion** in 2024 from digital and cross-border activities that were largely invisible just four years prior.1

### **Table 3.1: Malaysia Digital Tax Revenue Collection (2021-2024)**

| **Year** | **SToDS Revenue (RM)** | **LVG Revenue (RM)** | **Total Digital Tax Revenue (RM)** | **Year-on-Year Growth (SToDS)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **2021** | 802 Million | N/A | 802 Million | - |
| **2022** | 999 Million | N/A | 999 Million | +24.6% |
| **2023** | 1.15 Billion | N/A | 1.15 Billion | +15.1% |
| **2024** | 1.62 Billion | 476 Million | 2.096 Billion | +40.9% |

## **4. Thailand: The VAT on Electronic Services (VES) and Data Surveillance**

Thailand's approach to the invisible economy is characterized by a sophisticated integration of VAT policy with data surveillance mechanisms. The Thai Revenue Department (TRD) has systematically constructed a framework that not only taxes foreign platforms but also compels them to disclose data on the Thai merchants utilizing their services.

### **4.1 The VAT on Electronic Services (VES) Regime**

Enacted under the Revenue Code Amendment Act (No. 53) B.E. 2564, Thailand's VES regime came into effect on **September 1, 2021**.12 The law targets non-resident electronic service providers and electronic platforms that generate annual income exceeding **THB 1.8 million** from non-VAT registered customers in Thailand (essentially B2C transactions).13

The mechanism requires these foreign entities to register under a Simplified VAT System for E-Services (SVE), remit the standard **7% VAT**, and file monthly returns. Crucially, these entities cannot claim input tax credits, maximizing the net revenue for the Thai state.15

Fiscal Validation:

The revenue data confirms the immense scale of the Thai digital market. The TRD collected THB 4.2 billion in just the first six months of operations (October 2021 – March 2022), nearly matching the full-year target of THB 5 billion.13 By July 2022, collections had reached THB 5.9 billion, derived from a total service value of THB 85 billion.17 This "total service value" figure is a critical data point for the research paper, representing the hard floor of the B2C digital services market in Thailand.

### **4.2 The "Special Account" and Merchant Visibility**

While VES addresses foreign platforms, Thailand faced a parallel challenge with the domestic "invisible" economy of online sellers. To counter this, the TRD issued a notification effective **January 1, 2024**, requiring electronic platforms with revenues exceeding **THB 1 billion** to create a **"Special Account" (Banchi Phiset)**.18

This regulation compels platforms (e.g., Shopee, Lazada, TikTok Shop, Grab) to report detailed income data of the merchants operating on their systems to the Revenue Department. This effectively deputizes the platforms as information agents for the state, piercing the veil of anonymity that historically protected the informal gig economy and social commerce sectors. While industry associations warned this might drive sellers to informal channels like Facebook/Instagram direct sales 19, the overarching trend is toward inevitable transparency.

### **4.3 Digital Economy Contribution to GDP**

The National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) has leveraged these data streams to refine its calculation of the digital economy's impact. In 2023, the digital economy's contribution was estimated at approximately **12-13%** of GDP.20 The NESDC's Digital Economy Satellite Account (DESA) methodology creates a formal statistical framework that complements the fiscal data, confirming that digital activities are a primary engine of Thailand's post-pandemic recovery.22

## **5. Vietnam: The Automated Fiscal Dragnet**

Vietnam presents perhaps the most aggressive and successful case of enforcing digital sovereignty through administrative technology. The General Department of Taxation (GDT) has moved beyond policy to build a digital infrastructure that forces compliance through ease of use and strict enforcement.

### **5.1 The Electronic Portal for Foreign Contractors**

In March 2022, Vietnam launched a dedicated electronic portal for foreign suppliers, operationalizing Circular No. 80/2021/TT-BTC.24 This portal allows foreign entities without a permanent establishment—such as Google, Meta, Netflix, and TikTok—to register, declare, and pay taxes (VAT and Corporate Income Tax) directly from abroad.

This innovation bypassed the complex and often leaky withholding tax mechanisms that relied on local partners. By creating a direct pipe between Silicon Valley and Hanoi, the GDT effectively removed the "invisibility cloak" afforded by distance.

### **5.2 Revenue Performance and Compliance**

The results of this initiative have been staggering, reflecting an exponential increase in the captured tax base:

- **2022:** VND 1.85 trillion
- **2023:** VND 6.896 trillion
- **2024:** VND 8.693 trillion
- **2025 (Jan-Aug):** VND 8.71 trillion.2

As of August 2025, **170 foreign suppliers** had registered and paid taxes via the portal.2 The cumulative revenue from registered foreign suppliers reached nearly **VND 26.15 trillion** by late 2025.24 This data proves that when the mechanism for payment is simplified and enforcement is credible, the "invisible" economy willingly formalizes.

### **5.3 E-Commerce Tax Administration**

Domestically, Vietnam has achieved similar success in taxing local e-commerce. In 2023, tax revenue from e-commerce activities reached **VND 97 trillion**, a 16.87% increase year-on-year.26 By the first 11 months of 2024, this figure had surged to **VND 108 trillion** (approx. USD 4.25 billion).27

The GDT has also integrated its database with the Ministry of Industry and Trade and commercial banks, creating a surveillance triangulation that makes tax evasion increasingly difficult for online sellers. The requirement for banks to provide account information of sellers further cements this visibility.28

### **Table 5.1: Vietnam Digital Tax Revenue Growth (2022-2025)**

| **Period** | **Foreign Supplier Revenue (VND Trillion)** | **Domestic E-Commerce Revenue (VND Trillion)** | **Note** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **2022** | 1.85 | 83.0 | Portal Launch Year |
| **2023** | 6.90 | 97.0 | Full Implementation |
| **2024** | 8.69 | 108.0 (11 months) | Continued Expansion |
| **2025 (Jan-Aug)** | 8.71 | N/A | +40% YoY Growth |

## **6. The Philippines: Closing the Final Gap (Republic Act No. 12023)**

The Philippines was the last of the four nations to enact a specific digital services tax law, relying for years on ambiguous interpretations of existing codes. However, the enactment of **Republic Act No. 12023** in late 2024 marks the closure of the final major fiscal gap in ASEAN's digital landscape.

### **6.1 The VAT on Digital Services Law**

Signed into law on **October 2, 2024**, RA 12023 imposes a **12% VAT** on digital services provided by non-resident DSPs.29 The law is comprehensive, covering online search engines, marketplaces, cloud services, online media, and digital goods.

- **Threshold:** Non-resident DSPs with gross sales exceeding **PHP 3 million** (approx. USD 53,000) in a 12-month period must register for VAT.31
- **Implementation:** The law mandates the issuance of implementing rules and regulations (IRR) within 90 days, with VAT collection obligations commencing 120 days thereafter. This places the effective start date for revenue collection in mid-2025.29

### **6.2 Projected Impact and Fiscal Strategy**

The Department of Finance (DOF) projects that RA 12023 will generate **PHP 83.8 billion** in revenue between 2024 and 2028.31 This projection is critical for the research paper as it serves as an official government valuation of the previously uncaptured revenue streams.

Furthermore, the law explicitly designates **5% of the collected revenues** to support the local creative industry, acknowledging the need to reinvest in the domestic digital ecosystem while taxing foreign competitors.31

### **6.3 Digital Payments as the Enabler**

The feasibility of this tax is underpinned by the massive shift in the Philippines' payment landscape. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) reported that it surpassed its target of converting 50% of retail payments to digital formats by 2023. By 2024, **57.4%** of monthly retail payment volume and **59.0%** of value were digital.35

This shift is driven by **merchant payments**, which accounted for **66.4%** of digital volume in 2024.35 The ubiquity of **QR Ph** and the dominance of non-bank Electronic Money Issuers (EMIs) like GCash and Maya have created the digital trails necessary for the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to audit and enforce the new VAT law effectively.35

## **7. The Platform Economy: Quantifying the Value of the Invisible**

Beyond the fiscal lens, the invisible economy is quantified through the operational metrics of the platforms themselves. The Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) serves as the primary indicator of economic activity flowing through these digital conduits.

### **7.1 Regional GMV Dynamics**

The *e-Conomy SEA 2024* report by Google, Temasek, and Bain & Company highlights a pivotal shift: the region has moved from a "growth at all costs" model to a focus on **profitability**.

- **2024 GMV:** The region's digital economy GMV is projected to reach **$263 billion**, a 15% year-on-year increase.38
- **Revenue:** Revenues grew by 14% to **$89 billion**, with sector profits surging 2.5x to **$11 billion** over the past two years.5 This profitability signals that the "invisible" economy is stabilizing into a sustainable, formal industrial sector.

### **7.2 Country-Specific Platform Metrics**

The data reveals distinct characteristics for each market:

- **Thailand:**
- **GMV:** Projected to reach **$46 billion** in 2024.39
- **E-commerce:** The dominant sector, with GMV expected to hit **$26 billion** (19% growth).39
- **Food Delivery:** A consolidated market dominated by Grab and LINE MAN Wongnai. LINE MAN reported a 20% revenue increase in 2023, signaling a maturing market.40
- **Malaysia:**
- **GMV:** Estimated at **$31 billion** in 2024.41
- **E-commerce:** Valued at **$16 billion** (17% growth), heavily influenced by the new LVG tax which creates price parity for local goods.41
- **Travel:** The fastest-growing sector, surging 19% to **$8 billion** GMV as tourism recovers.41
- **Vietnam:**
- **GMV:** Projected to reach **$36 billion** in 2024.42
- **Transport & Food:** Vietnam distinguishes itself with the highest growth rate in food delivery in the region, with GMV reaching **$4 billion** (+12%).42
- **Digital Economy Contribution:** Official statistics place the digital economy's contribution to GDP between **16.5% and 18.3%** in 2023, driven by a robust ICT manufacturing base alongside platform services.21
- **Philippines:**
- **GMV:** Forecast to reach **$36 billion** in 2024, expanding by roughly 16-18%.45
- **High Growth Sectors:** The Philippines leads the region in **Transport and Food Delivery growth**, surging **20%** in 2024.45 This aligns with the BSP's data on the explosion of merchant payments.

### **Table 7.1: Comparative Platform Economy Metrics (2024 Projections)**

| **Metric** | **Thailand** | **Malaysia** | **Vietnam** | **Philippines** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Total GMV** | $46 Billion 39 | $31 Billion 41 | $36 Billion 42 | ~$36 Billion 45 |
| **E-commerce GMV** | $26 Billion | $16 Billion | High Growth | ~$24 Billion (2025 est) |
| **Transport/Food GMV** | >$4 Billion | $4 Billion | $4 Billion (+12%) | High Growth (+20%) |
| **Digital Econ % of GDP** | ~12-13% | 23.5% (2023) | ~16-18% | 8.5% |

## **8. The Infrastructure of Visibility: Payment Rails**

The "invisible economy" relies on digital payments to function at scale. The transition from cash to interoperable QR codes creates the digital footprint that allows tax authorities to audit platform revenue.

- **Thailand (PromptPay):** The backbone of Thai digital commerce. In 2022, PromptPay transaction volume hit **134.8 million transactions per day**.47 E-money transactions specifically used for purchases reached **402.9 million transactions** in Dec 2023 alone.48 This massive volume of identifiable transactions underpins the "Special Account" reporting requirement.
- **Malaysia (DuitNow):** E-payment adoption has surged to **409 transactions per capita** in 2024.49 The DuitNow QR system has seen a doubling of transaction volumes, integrating micro-SMEs into the formal banking system and, by extension, the tax net.50
- **Vietnam (VietQR):** Vietnam has witnessed a QR code explosion. In the first 11 months of 2023, QR payment volume grew by **106.7%**.51 This shift is critical for the GDT's ability to monitor e-commerce, as cash-on-delivery (which leaves no digital trace) is rapidly losing market share to digital payments.
- **Philippines (QR Ph):** The "Cash-lite" roadmap is a reality. With **57.4%** of retail payments now digital 35, the BIR has a significantly richer dataset for enforcing the new VAT law on digital services. The 148.7% growth in QR Ph merchants in 2024 directly correlates with the widening tax base.35

## **9. Conclusion: The End of Invisibility**

The research confirms that the "ASEAN Invisible Economy" is no longer invisible. It is being systematically mapped, measured, and monetized through a convergence of fiscal policy and digital infrastructure.

Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam have erected a robust fiscal architecture that successfully captures value from cross-border digital flows. The days of tax-free digital consumption are effectively over, replaced by a regime of 7-12% consumption taxes that generate billions of dollars in annual revenue. Concurrently, national statistical agencies and global analysts have developed precise metrics to quantify the sector's contribution to GDP and employment.

For the proposed research paper, the feasibility is **High**. The combination of **Central Bank payment data**, **Ministry of Finance/Revenue Department tax reports**, and **e-Conomy SEA market sizing** provides a triangulation methodology that can quantify the previously unquantifiable. The transition of the "invisible" economy into the "formal" economy is not just a theoretical prediction but a documented bureaucratic and statistical reality unfolding across the region.

The "invisible" economy has been found; it is now simply the **Digital Economy**, fully integrated into the sovereign fiscal machinery of Southeast Asia.
