## 🎯 HOW TO USE WITH HAIKU

### **Step 1: Share HAIKU_PRESENTATION_CONTENT.md**
Copy the entire content and paste into Haiku with this request:

```
"I'm presenting a 10-minute talk on energy-backed cryptocurrencies. 
I have a detailed presentation outline below. 

Please generate:
1. A complete PowerPoint presentation with speaker notes
2. A one-pager summary I can print for the audience
3. A visual guide showing exactly where to point on each graph
4. An expanded FAQ document for handling skeptical questions
5. Three audience-specific versions: one for crypto enthusiasts, 
   one for finance professionals, one for energy industry people

The presentation uses four specific graphs in a 2×2 grid layout.
Make sure your slides reference these graphs clearly.

Here's my content:"
```

Then paste the HAIKU_PRESENTATION_CONTENT.md content.

---

### **Step 2: Reference PRESENTATION_SCRIPT.md During Practice**
Use this to rehearse. Read it out loud. Get comfortable with the flow.

---

### **Step 3: Print QUICK_REFERENCE.md**
Print this one-pager and keep it with you during the presentation.

## 📋 WHAT'S IN EACH GRAPH (For Your Reference)

### **GRAPH 1: TOP-LEFT (Volatility Problem)**
- Shows: Three bars (worst, average, best case energy prices)
- Red line: Insurance cost
- Story: "Energy bounces around. This is the insurance cost to protect yourself."
- How to present: Point at each bar. Let stakes sink in.

### **GRAPH 2: BOTTOM-LEFT (Math Validation)**
- Shows: Error bars decreasing from N=50 to N=1000
- Story: "Error drops 99%. Answer is stable. Model is correct."
- How to present: Clinical but confident. Point at the trend.

### **GRAPH 3: BOTTOM-RIGHT (Method Agreement)**
- Shows: Blue bars (Binomial) overlapping red bars (Monte Carlo)
- Story: "Two different methods, same answer. Bulletproof."
- How to present: Let the overlap speak. Don't over-explain.

### **GRAPH 4: TOP-RIGHT (Global Pricing)**
- Shows: 5 bars (Germany cheapest to Brazil most expensive)
- Story: "Location determines risk. Physics determines cost."
- How to present: Scan across the bars. Point out 9x difference.

## 💡 THE CORE MESSAGE (For Quick Reference)

**Problem:** Energy prices are volatile. You need insurance.

**Solution:** We calculated the insurance cost: $0.0356/kWh for Taiwan.

**Proof:** Two independent methods agree within 0.3%. Error drops 99%.

**Implication:** Energy-backed cryptocurrency is mathematically proven.

**Closing:** Bitcoin IS backed. By energy. Proven. Measured. Real.
