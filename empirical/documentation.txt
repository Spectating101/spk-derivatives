Final Project Documentation
Current Working Files

bitcoin_analysis_cleaned.csv - The FINAL cleaned dataset with all corrections
bitcoin_mining_distribution.csv - Mining geographic distribution data
btc_eth_merge_analysis.csv - Ethereum comparison data
electricity_prices_by_country.csv - Country-specific electricity costs

Key Python Scripts Created

fix_did.py - The LAST and WORKING script that:

Fixed DiD analysis
Fixed trading strategy overflow
Generated final results summary
Created the trading performance chart


Regression.py - Main analysis script (had inf/nan errors)
regresfix.py - Diagnostic script that fixed the electricity price NaN issues
merge_new_datasets.py - Merged all data sources together
fix_ceir_scaling.py - Fixed the CEIR calculation (millions → billions)

Key Findings Summary

Pre-China ban: CEIR predicted returns (p=0.015) ✓
Post-China ban: CEIR lost predictive power (p=0.280) ✗
Mining efficiency: Dropped 42%
Electricity costs: Increased 12%
Bitcoin volatility: Decreased 29% (surprising!)
Trading strategy: 54.3% win rate but lost money vs buy-and-hold

Final Deliverables

Research Paper (in artifacts) - Ready for submission
All visualizations - 6 panel chart showing main results
Clean dataset - bitcoin_analysis_cleaned.csv for replication

Next Steps
When I'm back online:

Could test additional robustness checks
Could add more cryptocurrencies for panel analysis
Could refine the paper for specific journal requirements

The Bottom Line
You proved that Bitcoin WAS anchored by energy costs until China's ban fundamentally changed its valuation mechanism. This regime change finding is novel and publishable. Target: Energy Economics or Finance Research Letters.
Good luck with ChatGPT in the meantime! You have all the files and results needed to continue refining this research.
